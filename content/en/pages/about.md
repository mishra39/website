I am a Robotics Software Engineer specializing in motion planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). I collaborate with various autonomy groups to implement optimal, robust, and safe planning algorithms that enable robots to operate in diverse and challenging environments. I am particularly passionate about developing scalable and modular motion planning solutions that can be easily integrated as plug-and-play modules within autonomy stacks.

Currently, I am working on integrating and enhancing a perception-aware motion planning approach that utilizes B-Spline optimization to generate dynamically-feasible paths for quadrotors. Additionally, I develop efficient and high-performance GPU-accelerated code using CUDA and Thrust for Edge AI devices.

I hold a Master of Science in Controls and Robotics-Mechanical Engineering Research from Carnegie Mellon University, where I served as a Research Assistant at the [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/). My research focused on employing advanced computer vision algorithms for path planning in challenging environments and leveraging low-level controllers to execute the desired paths. Part of my work also involved hardware integration of robotic platforms to ensure they possess the required level of sensing capabilities.
