      <description>I am a Robotics Software Engineer with a focus on motion planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). I work with different autonomy groups to implement optimal, robust, and safe planning algorithms to help robots operate in diverse and challenging environments. I also ensure enjoy working on scalable and modular motion planning solutions that allow the user to plug-and-play them as modules in the autonomy stack. The video below shows some of the work I have done on the low SWaP-C (Size, Weight, Power, and Cost) team at Near Earth.</description>
