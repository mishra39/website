      <description>I am a Robotics Software Engineer with a focus on motion planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). I work with different groups to implement optimal, robust, and safe planning algorithms to help robots operate in diverse and challenging environments. I also ensure enjoy working on scalable and modular motion planning solutions that allow the user to plug-and-play them as modules in the autonomy stack.
Currently, I am working on integrating and improving a perception-aware motion planning approach that uses B-Spline optimization to find dynamically-feasible paths for quadrotors.</description>
